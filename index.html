            <div class="song__text">
                <p>I was a stranger in the city<br>
                    Out of town were the people I knew<br>
                    I had that feeling of self-pity<br>
                    What to do? What to do? What to do?<br>
                    The outlook was decidedly blue<br>
                    But as I walked through the foggy streets alone<br>
                    It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known</p>
                <p>A foggy day in London Town<br>
                    Had me low and had me down<br>
                    I viewed the morning with alarm<br>
                    The British Museum had lost its charm<br>
                    How long, I wondered, could this thing last?<br>
                    But the age of miracles hadn't passed,<br>
                    For, suddenly, I saw you there<br>
                    And through foggy London Town<br>
                    The sun was shining everywhere.</p>
