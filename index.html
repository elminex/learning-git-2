        <h2>Presenting: Michael Buble "A Foggy Day (In London Town)"</h2>
        <p>I was a stranger in the city
            Out of town were the people I knew
            I had that feeling of self-pity
            What to do? What to do? What to do?
            The outlook was decidedly blue
            But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
            It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known</p>
        <p>A foggy day in London Town
            Had me low and had me down
            I viewed the morning with alarm
            The British Museum had lost its charm
            How long, I wondered, could this thing last?</'p>
